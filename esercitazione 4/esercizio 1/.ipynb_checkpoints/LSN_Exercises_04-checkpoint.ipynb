    "In Statistical Mechanics the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution\" target=\"_blank\">Link Wikipedia</a>) is a probability distribution used for describing particle speeds in idealized gases. However, rarefied gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell–Boltzmann speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. For a 3D system its formula is:\n",
    "$$p(v,T) = \\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T} \\right)^{3/2} 4\\pi v^2 e^{-\\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By using LJ reduced units (Lenght: $\\sigma$; Energy: $\\epsilon$; Mass: the mass, $m$, of the particles; Temperature: $\\epsilon/k_B$; velocity: $\\sqrt{\\epsilon/m}$) its form becomes:\n",
    "$$p(v^*,T^*) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi T^*)^{3/2}} 4\\pi (v^*)^2 e^{-\\frac{(v^*)^2}{2 T^*}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSL_SIMULATOR code already computes the total (internal) energy per particle, $E/N$, the potential energy per particle, $U/N$, the kinetic energy per particle, $K/N$, the temperature, $T$, and the pressure, $P$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, $p(v^*,T^*)$, can be approximately computed as a **normalized histogram** on an appropriate interval $\\left[ 0, v_{max}\\right]$ and chosing the number of bins into which you want to divide this interval."
